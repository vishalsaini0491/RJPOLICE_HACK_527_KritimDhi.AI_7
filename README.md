Our these two prototypes basically have this following functionality for now:

     I. Real Time Transaction Monitoring ( Bank Server Level Only )
    II. Updating cyber police in real time on their dashboard as the fraud happens, that data they can use for quickly setup an investigation for that fraud.
   III. In second prototype we have also embedded an dashboard which cyber police can use to analyze the whole data set of various kind of transactions. 

**Note:** 

1. We weren't to upload our dataset and Dashboard for data analysis due size constraint present on github. So we are uploading the drive's link on github. Please refer to the link given below. This link contains dataset, video of working of two prototypes we have developed and our Power BI dashboard which we embedded in the web app.

2. We have deployed this ML model for prototype stage locally using streamlit library of python which is an open source library for creating quick web applications and also for deployig ML model locally.
   
3. These web applications are just to showcase the prototype with limited functionalities. We have divided our long term vision with this project in 4 different stages which are:

   Stage I:
    Expanding functionalities
         - Risk scores for each transaction 
         - More better & advance analytics
   Stage II:
    Deepening Fraud Analysis
         - Automated Investigation
         - Behavioral Profiling
         - Predictive Modeling
         - Uncovering larger criminal networks

   Stage III:
     Expanding throughout India
         - Giving Multilingual Support For Software 
         - Spreading Awareness
         - Partnering with various financial institutions
         - Targeting different verticals 
   
   Stage IV:
     **Reaching Global Audience**
